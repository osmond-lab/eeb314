In ecology &amp; evolution this might be how we think a virus will spread and evolve, how climate change will impact a threatened population, or how much genetic diversity we expect to see in a randomly mating population. In this course you'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through readings, lectures, computer labs, and a final project. Our focus is on deterministic dynamical models (recursions and differential equations), which requires us to learn and use some calculus and linear algebra.</p> <p>Please see the University of Toronto Academic Calendar for more details on the course prerequisites and additional information on the distribution/breadth requirements this course satisfies.</p> <p>Next taught: Fall 2025</p> <p>Previously taught: Fall 2024, Fall 2022 (EEB430), Fall 2021 (EEB430)</p>"},{"location":"acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>This course is based on a fantastic textbook by Sally Otto and Troy Day, A biologist's guide to mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution.

It has long been clear that such events can impact the size of a population, e.g., by causing extra mortality, and may in fact put populations at risk of extinction. More recently it has become apparent that extreme events can also impose strong natural selection, and that populations can quickly adapt to the new environment.

The reason for this is that, while during the extreme event (shaded section) evolution is adaptive, once the extreme event ends the population finds itself maladapted to the original environment. Adaptive evolution can therefore hamper population persistence, and this is an important thing to keep in mind when documenting rapid adaptive evolution in response to extreme events -- it is not necessarily a good thing for the species (or our conservation goals).</p>\n<p></p>"},{"location":"lectures/lecture-01/#2-how-to-build-a-model","title":"2.

Now we can ask what \\(p(t+1)\\) is given this updated value of \\(p(t)\\) by drawing another vertical blue line, and so on.

Correspondingly, we see that the internal equilibrium is stable in the left plot and unstable in the right plot. To more precisely determine the boundary between stability and instability we need to perform our local stability analysis.</p> <p>We start the stability analysis by taking the derivative of \\(p(t+1)\\) as a function of \\(p(t)\\), using the quotient rule</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}p(t)}\\left(\\frac{W_{AA}p(t)^2 + W_{Aa}p(t)(1-p(t))}{\\bar{W}(p(t))}\\right)\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{(2W_{AA}p(t) + W_{Aa}(1-2p(t)))\\bar{W}(p(t))}{\\bar{W}(p(t))^2}\\\\ &amp;-\\frac{(W_{AA}p(t)^2+W_{Aa}p(t)(1-p(t)))(2W_{AA}p(t)+2W_{Aa}(1-2p(t))-2(1-p(t))W_{aa})}{\\bar{W}(p(t))^2}. \\end{aligned} \\] <p>This is a complicated expression! Fortunately stability is determined by the value of this derivative evaluated at \\(p(t)=\\hat{p}\\), which can be considerably simpler. </p> <p>Let's start with \\(\\hat{p} = 0\\). In this case we have </p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p(t+1)}{\\mathrm{d}p(t)}\\right|_{p(t)=0} &amp;= \\frac{W_{Aa}\\bar{W}(0)}{\\bar{W}(0)^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{W_{Aa}}{\\bar{W}(0)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{W_{Aa}}{W_{aa}}. \\end{aligned} \\] <p>And similarly for \\(\\hat p = 1\\), we have</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p(t+1)}{\\mathrm{d}p(t)}\\right|_{p(t)=1} &amp;= \\frac{(2W_{AA} - W_{Aa})\\bar{W}(1) - W_{AA}(2W_{AA}-2W_{Aa})}{\\bar{W}(1)^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(2W_{AA} - W_{Aa})W_{AA} - W_{AA}(2W_{AA}-2W_{Aa})}{W_{AA}^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2W_{AA} - W_{Aa} - 2W_{AA}+2W_{Aa}}{W_{AA}}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{W_{Aa}}{W_{AA}}. \\end{aligned} \\] <p>Since fitness is always greater than or equal to zero, \\(W_i\\geq0\\), so are these derivatives. We therefore know that they are greater than -1 and what is left for stability is to determine when they are less than 1. This will occur whenever the numerator is less than the denominator, meaning that \\(\\hat p = 0\\) is stable when \\(W_{Aa} &lt; W_{aa}\\) and \\(\\hat p = 1\\) is stable when \\(W_{Aa} &lt; W_{AA}\\). This makes good sense. Take \\(\\hat p = 0\\) for example. This means that the \\(a\\) allele is fixed. When we introduce just a few \\(A\\) alleles, \\(p(t) &lt;&lt; 1\\), they will occur in heterozygotes because it is very unlikely that they pair with each other under under random mating, \\(p(t)^2\\approx0\\). So the spread of the \\(A\\) allele and an increase in \\(p\\) is determined by the spread of the heterozygote, which is prevented by selection when \\(W_{Aa} &lt; W_{aa}\\). The same reasoning holds for \\(\\hat p = 1\\). Check that these stability criteria are consistent with the cobweb plots above.</p> <p>Now for the internal equilibrium. It's stability is determined the same way, but this time we skip the algebra for the sake of time</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p(t+1)}{\\mathrm{d}p(t)}\\right|_{p(t)=\\frac{W_{Aa} - W_{aa}}{2W_{Aa} - W_{AA} - W_{aa}}} &amp;= \\frac{W_{AA}W_{Aa}-2W_{AA}W_{aa}+W_{Aa}W_{aa}}{W_{Aa}^2-W_{AA}W_{aa}}. \\end{aligned} \\] <p>Not bad. Now let's consider the two scenarios under which this internal equilibrium is biologically valid.</p> <p>In case A we have overdominance, \\(W_{AA} &lt; W_{Aa} &gt; W_{aa}\\). This means that both numerator and denominator are positive. Since the derivative is positive it is always greater than -1 and all that is left for stability is for the derivative to be less than 1, ie the numerator is less than the denominator</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} W_{AA}W_{Aa}-2W_{AA}W_{aa}+W_{Aa}W_{aa} &amp;&lt; W_{Aa}^2-W_{AA}W_{aa}\\\\ W_{AA}W_{Aa}-W_{AA}W_{aa}+W_{Aa}W_{aa} - W_{Aa}^2 &amp;&lt; 0, \\end{aligned} \\] <p>which is always true with \\(W_{AA} &lt; W_{Aa} &gt; W_{aa}\\), implying stability with overdominance.</p> <p>In case B we have underdominance, \\(W_{AA} &gt; W_{Aa} &lt; W_{aa}\\). This means that both numerator and denominator are negative. Since the derivative is positive it is always greater than -1 and all that is left for stability is for the derivative to be less than 1, which is the condition we just derived in the equation above. In case B however, the condition never holds, implying instability with underdominance.</p> <p>In sum, the internal equilibrium is biologically valid and locally stable only if there is overdominance, \\(W_{AA} &lt; W_{Aa} &gt; W_{aa}\\). This makes good intuitive sense since there are more heterozygotes at a more intermediate frequency (\\(2p(1-p)\\) has a max at \\(p=1/2\\)). It also implies that the internal equilibrium is stable when the boundary equilibria are unstable, and vice versa. When the internal equilibrium is unstable it therefore acts as a replellor between two locally stable equilibria, pushing allele frequency towards the boundary that is on the same side of the repellor.

Well, when the determinant is zero, \\(|\\mathbf{M}|=0\\), it means that the rows are not linearly independent, that is, some row \\(\\vec{r}_k\\) can be written as \\(a_1 \\vec{r}_1 + \\cdots + a_{k-1} \\vec{r}_{k-1} + a_{k+1} \\vec{r}_{k+1} + \\cdots + a_n \\vec{r}_n\\), where the \\(a_i\\) are scalars and the \\(\\vec{r}_i\\) are the rows of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\). As a result, when we multiply a vector by a matrix with a determinant of zero we lose some information and therefore cannot reverse the operation. This is analagous to mutliplying by 0 in normal algebra -- if we multiply a bunch of different numbers by zero we have no way of reversing the operation to know what the original numbers were. So, a matrix is invertible if and only if it has a nonzero determinant, \\(|\\mathbf{M}|\\neq0\\). Matrices that are not invertible are called singular.</p> <p>Geometrically, mutliplying multiple vectors by a matrix whose deteriminant is zero causes them to fall along a line. Below we multiply the two black vectors by a matrix whose determinant is zero to get the two red vectors, which fall along the same line. We have lost information and cannot undue the operation to recover the original vectors.</p> <pre>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import plotting library\nfrom sympy import *\n\nv1 = Matrix([[2],[1]]) #column vector 1\nv2 = Matrix([[1],[1]]) #column vector 2\nM = Matrix([[1/2,1],[1,2]]) #matrix with determinant of zero\n\n#original vectors\nfor v in [v1,v2]:\n    plt.arrow(0, 0, #starting x and y values of arrow\n              float(v[0]), float(v[1]), #change in x and y \n              head_width=0.1, color='black', length_includes_head=True) #aesthetics\n\n#stretched and rotated vectors\nfor v in [M*v1,M*v2]:\n    plt.arrow(0, 0, #starting x and y values of arrow\n              float(v[0]), float(v[1]), #change in x and y \n              head_width=0.1, color='red', length_includes_head=True) #aesthetics\n\nplt.xlim(0,5) #set bounds on x axis\nplt.ylim(0,5) #set bounds on y axis\nplt.show()\n</pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"lectures/lecture-07/#inverting","title":"Inverting","text":"<p>Now back to how to find the inverse of a matrix.</p> <p>For an invertible 2x2 matrix we do the following</p> \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{M}^{-1}  =&amp;\\begin{pmatrix}   a &amp; b \\\\   c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{M}|} \\begin{pmatrix}   d  &amp; -b \\\\   -c &amp; a \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{pmatrix}   d  &amp; -b \\\\   -c &amp; a \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix}   \\frac{d}{ad-bc}  &amp; \\frac{-b}{ad-bc} \\\\   \\frac{-c}{ad-bc} &amp; \\frac{a}{ad-bc} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align} \\] <p>Larger matrices are more difficult to invert by hand.

But through experience we notice that there is an easier approach. </p> <p>Because the second equation is proportional to \\(\\hat{I}\\) we immediately know \\(\\hat{I}=0\\) is one potential equilibrium point. For this to work we also need the first equation to be zero. Subbing in \\(\\hat{I}=0\\) to that first equation and solving for \\(\\hat{S}\\) gives \\(\\hat{S}=\\theta/d\\). One equilibrium is therefore</p> \\[\\begin{aligned} \\hat{S} &amp;= \\theta/d \\\\ \\hat{I} &amp;= 0, \\end{aligned}\\] <p>which we call the \"disease-free\" equilibrium. At this equilibrium there is no disease (\\(\\hat{I}=0\\)) and the number of susceptibles is determined by the balance between immigration and disease-independent death (\\(\\hat{S}=\\theta/d\\)). This is always biologically valid (given the parameters are positive, which we can assume given the description of the model above).</p> <p>Now, there may be more than one equilibrium because this is a non-linear model. Returning to the second equation, after factoring out \\(\\hat{I}\\) we are left with \\(0 = \\beta \\hat{S} - (d + v + \\gamma)\\), implying \\(\\hat{S} = (d + v + \\gamma)/\\beta\\).

This is due to the fact that the frequencies always sum to one, \\(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=1\\). We therefore effectively have a three dimensional model, e.g., we could just track \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) because we know that \\(x_4 = 1 - x_1-x_2-x_3\\).</p> <p>The second and third eigenvalues, \\(\\lambda_2 = w_{12}/w_{11}\\) and \\(\\lambda_3 = w_{13}/w_{11}\\), are analogous to what we found in the 1 locus (univariate) case. Remembering that stability in discrete time requires that the eigenvalues are less than 1 in absolute value, we can interpret these eigenvalues as saying that the \\(B_2\\) allele can invade when it has higher fitness than the \\(B_1\\) allele (\\(w_{12}&gt;w_{11}\\)) and the \\(A_2\\) can invade when it has higher fitness than the \\(A_1\\) allele (\\(w_{13}&gt;w_{11}\\)). If either allele can invade our equilibrium is unstable. </p> <p>The fourth eigenvalue, \\(\\lambda_4 = (1-r)w_{14}/w_{11}\\), is the new part, which depends on recombination. Interestingly, here, even if \\(A_2B_2\\) has higher fitness than \\(A_1B_1\\), meaning \\(w_{14}&gt;w_{11}\\), it is possible that the \\(A_2B_2\\) genotype cannot invade. This is because, for a rare \\(A_2B_2\\) genotype, every generation it pairs with the common \\(A_1B_1\\) genotype and therefore gets broken apart into \\(A_1B_2\\) and \\(A_2B_1\\) by recombination with probability \\(r\\). In other words, recombination can hinder the spread of an adaptive combination of alleles. This is epitiomized by the scenario where having a single \"2\" allele is deleterious \\(w_{12}&lt;w_{11}\\) and \\(w_{13}&lt;w_{11}\\) (making \\(\\lambda_2&lt;1\\) and \\(\\lambda_3&lt;1\\)) but having two \"2\" alleles is beneficial, \\(w_{14}&gt;w_{11}\\).

Below we draw a flow diagram representing all the transitions between calves, sexually immature individuals, sexually mature individuals, and actively reproducing individuals.</p> <pre><code>graph LR;\n    C((Calves)) --sIC nC--&gt; I((Immature));\n\n    I --sII nI--&gt; I;\n    I --sMI nI--&gt; M((Mature));\n    I --sRI nI--&gt; R((Reproductive));\n\n    M --sMM nM--&gt; M;\n    M --sRM nM--&gt; R;\n\n    R --sRR nR--&gt; R;\n    R --sMR nR--&gt; M;\n    R --b nR--&gt; C;</code></pre> <p>Converting this flow diagram into a system of recursion equations, \\(\\vec{n}(t+1) = \\mathbf{M}\\vec{n}(t)\\), the projection matrix is</p> \\[ \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; b \\\\ s_{IC} &amp; s_{II} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; s_{MI} &amp; s_{MM} &amp; s_{MR} \\\\ 0 &amp; s_{RI} &amp; s_{RM} &amp; s_{RR} \\end{pmatrix} \\] <p>If we now plug in some estimated parameter values from the literature (\\(b=0.3\\), \\(s_{IC}=0.92\\), \\(s_{II}=0.86\\), \\(s_{MI}=0.08\\), \\(s_{MM}=0.8\\), \\(s_{MR}=0.88\\), \\(s_{RI}=0.02\\), \\(s_{RM}=0.19\\), \\(s_{RR}=0\\)) we can numerically calculate the three key demographic quantities</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\lambda_1 \\approx 1.003 \\\\ &amp;\\vec{v}_1 \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0.04 \\\\ 0.23 \\\\ 0.61 \\\\ 0.12\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &amp;\\vec{u}_1 \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0.69 &amp; 0.76 &amp; 1.07 &amp; 1.15 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{aligned} \\] <p>These quantitives tells us, for example, that in the long-run the population is predicted to grow (\\(\\lambda_1&gt;1\\)), the majority of individuals are expected to be mature (the second last entry in \\(\\vec{v}_1\\) is the largest), and mature and reproductive individuals are expected to have much higher reproductive values than calves and immature individuals (the last two entries in \\(\\vec{u}_1\\) are much larger than the first two). </p> <p>Caveat</p> <p>The parameter values above were estimated before the current population decline -- changes in climate and human behaviour, eg boat traffic and fishing, have presumably altered the parameter values, making the predictions less accurate. For example, the increased incidence of entanglement in fishing nets has likely decreased survival rates to the point that the population is now expected to decline. See here for more info.</p> <p>We can now answer an important conservation question: </p> <p>Question</p> <p>If we wanted to increase the total population size in the future and we could add one individual to any stage, which stage should it be?</p> <p>We want to know what entry of \\(\\vec{n}(0)\\) to add 1 to to maximize \\(\\vec{n}(t) \\approx \\lambda^t \\vec{v}_1 \\vec{u}_1 \\vec{n}(0)\\). This will not affect the long-term growth rate (\\(\\lambda_1\\)) or the stable-stage distribution (\\(\\vec{v}_1\\)). We can therefore only increase \\(\\vec{u}_1\\vec{n}(0) = u_1 n_1(0) + u_2 n_2(0) + ... + u_m n_m(0)\\). And so we add 1 to the stage with the largest reproductive value, \\(u_i\\).</p> <p>So for these whales, where the reproductive values are \\(\\vec{u}_1 \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0.69 &amp; 0.76 &amp; 1.07 &amp; 1.15 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we should add a reproductively active individual. This is perhaps not surprising since those are the only individuals that produce offspring and if we introduced an individual in an earlier stage there is some chance that they would die before becoming reproductively active.</p> <p>One other question we might now consider is:</p> <p>Question</p> <p>If we wanted to increase the long-term population growth rate and we could increase any parameter a little bit, which parameter should it be?</p> <p>One way to answer this is to numerically calculate the long-term population growth rate, \\(\\lambda_1\\), for a range of values of one parameter, \\(z\\) (e.g., we might take \\(z=b\\), the fecundity of reproductive individuals).</p> <p>Or, we could try to analytically compute the rate of change in the leading eigenvalue with respect to \\(z\\), \\(\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1/\\mathrm{d}z\\), while considering \\(\\mathbf{M}\\), \\(\\lambda_1\\), \\(\\vec{v}_1\\), and \\(\\vec{u}_1\\) to be functions of \\(z\\). </p> <p>Since \\(\\mathbf{M}\\vec{v}_1 = \\lambda_1 \\vec{v}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{u}_1\\mathbf{M} = \\vec{u}_1\\lambda_1\\) we have</p> \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{M} \\vec{v}_1 &amp;= \\lambda_1 \\vec{v}_1 \\\\ \\vec{u}_1 \\mathbf{M} \\vec{v}_1 &amp;= \\vec{u}_1 \\lambda_1 \\vec{v}_1 \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\left(\\vec{u}_1 \\mathbf{M} \\vec{v}_1 \\right)&amp;= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\left(\\vec{u}_1 \\lambda_1 \\vec{v}_1 \\right)\\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{u}_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\mathbf{M} \\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{u}_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{M}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{u}_1 \\mathbf{M} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{v}_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} &amp;= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{u}_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\lambda_1 \\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{u}_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{u}_1 \\lambda_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{v}_1}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\\\ \\vec{u}_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{M}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\vec{v}_1 &amp;= \\vec{u}_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\vec{v}_1 \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} &amp;= \\frac{\\vec{u}_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{M}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\vec{v}_1}{\\vec{u}_1 \\vec{v}_1} \\end{aligned}\\] <p>We call \\(\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1/\\mathrm{d}z\\) the sensitivity of \\(\\lambda_1\\) to \\(z\\).</p> <p>This expression will be too complicated to understand in general in most cases, but we can evaluate at some particular value \\(z^*\\) (e.g., at the current estimate) to see how the growth rate changes as \\(z\\) increases from that value</p> \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\bigg|_{z=z^*} = \\frac{\\vec{u}_1 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{M}}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\big|_{z=z^*} \\right) \\vec{v}_1}{\\vec{u}_1 \\vec{v}_1} \\] <p>Returning to our question, we want to know which parameter, \\(z\\), gives the largest value of \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\big|_{z=z^*}\\).</p> <p>For these whales we can calculate \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{d}z} \\big|_{z=z^*}\\) for each parameter \\(z\\) (ie, for each entry in \\(\\mathbf{M}\\)) evaluated at it's current value \\(z^*\\).

We can extend this analysis to consider structured populations of mutants, e.g., age- or spatial-structure.

The motivating observation is that many deleterious alleles are recessive, meaning the wild-type allele partially shields a heterozygote individual from selection. There are many examples in humans, such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. In these examples the fitness of heterozygous individuals is indistinguishable from those without any deleterious mutations.

However, we can calculate the expectation since we know the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations</p> \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}(M_n)  &amp;= \\mathbb{E}(T_n + T_{n-1} + ... + T_2)\\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{E}(T_n) + \\mathbb{E}(T_{n-1}) + ... + \\mathbb{E}(T_2)\\\\ &amp;= 1/p_n + 1/p_{n-1} + ... + 1/p_2\\\\ &amp;\\approx \\frac{2N}{{n \\choose 2}} + \\frac{2N}{{n-1 \\choose 2}} + ... + \\frac{2N}{{2 \\choose 2}}\\\\ &amp;= 2N \\sum_{i=2}^n \\frac{1}{{i \\choose 2}} \\\\ &amp;= 4N \\frac{n-1}{n} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] <p>Since \\((n-1)/n&lt;1\\) we see that all \\(n\\) sample lineages are expected to coalesce in less than \\(4N\\) generations. This is pretty remarkable given we expect to wait more than half that time just for 2 sample lineages to coalesce! The reason for this is that coalescence happens faster when there are more lineages (since there are more pairs to choose from). So if we take a large sample then most of the lineages will coalesce very quickly and most of the time spent waiting for the most recent common ancestor will be once few lineages remain. Below we take advantage of a great Python package, <code>msprime</code>, to quickly simulate the coalescent with \\(n\\) samples and plot the history of those samples (a coalescent tree).</p> <pre>\nimport msprime\nn = 10\nts = msprime.sim_ancestry(n) #simulate coalescent with n samples\nts.first().draw_svg(node_labels={}, size=(500,300)) #plot tree without node labels\n</pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"lectures/schedule/","title":"Schedule","text":"<p>Under construction for Fall 2025 edition.

For the smaller multicellular strategies (1+1+1 and 1+2) we were able to show these conditions analytically, in general. For the larger multicellular strategies (1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, and 2+2), where the eigenvalues are more complicated, we turned to a numerical example. </p> <p>For 1+1+1, invasion requires cell division to be faster than death in groups of size 2, \\(b_2&gt;d_2\\). Essentially, the benefit a cell receives from being in a group (\\(b_2\\)) needs to outweigh the costs (\\(d_2\\)). It is interesting that this does not depend on the cell division and death rates in groups of size 1, \\(b_1\\) and \\(d_1\\). This is likely because all offspring of both the unicellular and multicellular strategy are size 1, so both strategies are affected equally by changes in \\(b_1\\) and \\(d_1\\).</p> <p>For 1+2, invasion requires the cell division rate in groups of size 2 relative to that in groups of size 1 to be greater than the death rate in groups of size 2 relative to that in groups of size 1, \\(b_2/b_1&gt;d_2/d_1\\). This may be the case if groups of cells cooperate by sharing resources or protecting each other from the environment, which would increase \\(b_2/b_1\\) or decrease \\(d_2/d_1\\).</p> <p>For larger multicellular strategies, our numerical example indicates that the invasion rate increases with the number of offspring.  Those strategies with 2 offspring (1+3 and 2+2) behave much like 1+2 while the strategy with 3 offspring behaves much like 1+1+1. It is the strategy with 4 offspring (1+1+1+1) that has the highest invasion growth rate and thus appears most like to invade a unicellular ancestor under this model. As shown in the figure below, this is despite the fact that the 1+1+1+1 strategy does not have the highest growth rate in the absence of competitors. Instead, it appears that having more (and hence smaller) offspring at the time of fragmenting makes a strategy more competitive, presumably because this increases the chances of winning a spot. </p> <pre>\n# chose parameter values\npvals = {'b1':1.0,'d1':0.1,'d2':0.1,'d3':0.1,'k':100,'b3':1.0}\nb2s = np.linspace(0,2,100) #range to plot over\nnhat = 0 #no unicellular individuals\n\n#plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M111, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='1+1+1')\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M12, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='1+2')\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M1111, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='1+1+1+1')\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M112, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='1+1+2')\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M13, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='1+3')\nplot_invasion_rate(M=M22, nhat=nhat, pvals=pvals, b2s=b2s, ax=ax, label='2+2')\n\nax.plot(b2s, [0 for _ in b2s], c='k') #0 line for reference (invade if above this line)\n\nplt.xlabel(r'$b_2$')\nplt.ylabel('invasion growth rate')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n</pre> <p></p> <p>Figure 2.

For one, I have only looked at the invasion of a multicellular strategy into the unicellular resident. It therefore remains unclear if an invading multicellular strategy will completely displace the unicellular strategy or the both will coexist. Looking at the reverse situation, where the unicellular strategy invades a multicellular strategy would help answer this. Further, it is unclear how the multicellular strategies compete with each other. Exploring this would help us understand how and why complex multicellular organisms, like ourselves, have evolved. Another interesting direction is to allow competition to depend on the size of a group, for instance by making larger groups more likely to win spots resided by smaller groups. And finally, it would be interesting to include different cell types, like cooperators and cheaters, as multicellularity opens the door to within-group conflict, which may affect which strategies invade best.</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/final_project/partI_example/","title":"Final project part I - example","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This is a made-up example inspired by the research of Sydney Ackermann, an MSc student in the Osmond lab, who was in turn inspired by the models of Roze &amp; Michod and Pichugin et al..</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/final_project/partI_example/#biological-question","title":"Biological question","text":"<p>I am interested in the origin of multicellularity and the reason why particular life-cycles predominate.

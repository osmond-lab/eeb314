    "As a biological example, consider a population of zooplankton, such as daphnia, that feeds on algal species of different sizes. For simplicity we'll assume that each daphnid has a feeding strategy characterized by the alga that it is best able to consume. We'll also assume that being able to feed well on large algae comes at the expense of being able to feed on small algae (i.e., there is a *trade-off* between being able to feed on alga types)."

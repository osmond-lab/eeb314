    "The Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model assumes that the density of prey, $N$, grows logistically in the absence of predators, with per capita growth rate $r$ and carrying capacity $k$. Predators, with density $P$, consume prey at a per prey per predator rate of $a/(1+b N)$. The form of this per capita consumption rate implies that the rate of prey eaten per predator asymptotes to $a/b$ as $N$ gets large; essentially, we assume it takes some time for a predator to eat a prey, limiting the rate prey are consumed even when there are many of them. Finally, we assume each consumed prey is converted into a fraction $c$ new predators (i.e., consuming $1/c$ prey is required to make a new predator), and that predators die at per capita rate $d$. Putting all this together in a continuous-time model we have\n",

This is called the paradox of enrichment, because enriching the resources available for prey (increasing $k$) might be (naively) expected to lead to more prey and hence more stable predator-prey coexistence."

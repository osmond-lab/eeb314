    "Consider a population composed of $S$ susceptible individuals and $I$ infected individuals. We assume new susceptible individuals arrive at rate $\\theta$ via immigration and existing susceptibles die at per capita rate $d$. We assume infected individuals die at an elevated per capita rate $d+v$ and recover at per capita rate $\\gamma$. So far this is a linear (affine) model. Finally, we assume susceptibles become infected at rate $\\beta S I$. This is the non-linear part.\n",

The trace is $-\\frac{\\beta \\theta - d \\gamma}{d+v}$, so for this to be negative we need $\\beta \\theta/d > \\gamma$, which is guaranteed if the determinant is positive. So in conclusion, the endemic equilibrium is valid and stable whenever the disease can invade, $R_0>1$."

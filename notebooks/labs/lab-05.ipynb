    "Let's put this into practice by analyzing what is known as \"Kimura's two-parameter model of mutation\". Here we model how the number of adenines ($n_A$), guanines ($n_G$), cytosines ($n_C$), and thymines ($n_T$), in a sequence of DNA changes over generations. We assume that *transitions* (from A to G, G to A, C to T, and T to C) happen with probability $\\alpha$ per generation while *transversions* (the remainder of mutations, which are generally less likely because they alter the ring structure of the DNA) happen with probability $\\beta$ per generation. We assume no other force but mutation is acting (this is a \"neutral\" model, where there is no selection). The system of linear recursion equations is, in matrix form,\n",

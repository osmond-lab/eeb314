    "The Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model assumes that the density of prey, $N$, grows logistically in the absence of predators, with per capita growth rate $r$ and carrying capacity $k$. Predators, with density $P$, consume prey at a per prey per predator rate of $a/(1+b N)$. The form of this per capita consumption rate implies that the rate of prey eaten per predator asymptotes to $a/b$ as $N$ gets large; essentially, we assume it takes some time for a predator to eat a prey, limiting the rate prey are consumed even when there are many of them. Finally, we assume each consumed prey is converted into a fraction $c$ new predators (i.e., consuming $1/c$ prey is required to make a new predator), and that predators die at per capita rate $d$. Putting all this together in a continuous-time model we have\n",

    "Derive the nullclines (it may be simpler to do this by hand) and plot them, with $N$ on the x-axis and $P$ on the y-axis, for the three sets of parameter values below (the first two give a stable coexistence equilibrium, the latter makes it unstable). Relate this to your stability analyses by showing that the slope of prey nullcline has the opposite sign as the trace of the Jacobian, meaning the coexistence equilibrium will be stable if and only if the predator nullcline crosses the descending portion of the prey nullcline."

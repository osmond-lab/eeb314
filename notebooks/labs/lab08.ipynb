    "# Lab 8: Demography\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture we discussed how we can apply what we know about linear multivariate models to populations structured by stage or age (demography). There we looked at two examples: a stage-structured model of North Atlantic right whales and an age-structured model of stickleback. In both cases we assumed we had good estimates of the entries in the transition matrix. Here we'll see how to build a transition matrix from data, and how to analyze a larger transition matrix with the help of Python.\n",

    "## The demography of Canadians\n",
    "\n",
    "Following section 10.6 in the text, here we'll use data from past censuses to build a Leslie matrix and analyze how the demography of Canadians is expected to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the census takes place every 5 years, instead of tracking individuals of each age we'll track individuals in 5-year incremements: 0-4 years, 5-9 years, .... This ensures all individuals in a given age class will either die or move to the next age class, i.e., we get a Leslie matrix. We'll also group all individuals over 85 into the final age class, which means that we have a \"modified Leslie matrix\" with a non-zero survival probability of staying in the final age class from one time steo to the next. Because these individuals in the final age class do not reproduce, this actually doesn't complicate things much.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll track just the number of females in each age class for simplicity (a classic approach when the number of offspring produced does not depend on the number of males), so we'll have to multiply the number of offspring by the sex ratio (fraction female) to get the expected number of female offspring.\n",
    "\n",
